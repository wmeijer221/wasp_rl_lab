# WASP Reinforcement Learning 2022
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the lab assignment during the second on-site meeting.

If you don't have it, [install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), its available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
You only need to install a small number of packages. This can be done directly from the notebook. Alternatively, you can install them in a virtual (or global) environment like this: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Note that when you have access to a GPU, you should consider to [install PyTorch manually](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), with the correct CUDA version selected.

And that is all in terms of setup. All tasks are described in the notebook `Lab.ipynb`. Have fun :)
